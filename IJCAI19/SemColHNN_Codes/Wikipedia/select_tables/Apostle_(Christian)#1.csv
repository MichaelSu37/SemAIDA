"Barnabas","Acts 14:14","Ã¢\u0080\u0094"
"Andronicus and Junia","Rom 16:7","Paul states that Andronicus and Junia were \"of note among the apostles.\" This has been traditionally interpreted in one of two ways: That Andronicus and Junia were \"of note among the apostles,\" that is, distinguished apostles.[16] That Andronicus and Junia were \"well known among the apostles\" meaning \"well known to the apostles\" In the first view it is believed that Paul is referring to a female apostle.[17][18] Unhappy with reference to a female apostle, editors and translators have often changed the name to \"Junias,\" the masculine version of Junia, as in the Revised Standard Version.[18] While \"Junia\" was a common name, \"Junias\" was not.[18] In the second view, it is believed that Paul is simply making mention of the outstanding character of these two people which was acknowledged by the apostles. Historically it has been virtually impossible to tell which of the two views were correct. The second view, in recent years, has been defended from a scholarly perspective by Daniel Wallace and Michael Burer.[19]"
"Silas","1 Thes. 1:1, 2:6","Referred to as one along with Timothy and Paul, he also performs the functioning of an apostle as Paul's companion in Paul's second missionary journey in Acts 15:40ff."
"Timothy","1 Thes. 1:1, 2:6","Timothy is referred to as an apostle in along with Silas and Paul. However, in 2 Cor. 1:1 he is only called a \"brother\" when Paul refers to himself as \"an apostle of Christ\". Timothy performs many of the functions of an apostle in the commissioning of Paul in 1st and 2nd Timothy, though in those epistles Paul refers to him as his \"son\" in the faith."
"Apollos","1 Cor. 4:9","Included among \"us apostles\" along with Paul and Cephas (Peter). (see also: 4:6, 3:22, and 3:4-6)"
