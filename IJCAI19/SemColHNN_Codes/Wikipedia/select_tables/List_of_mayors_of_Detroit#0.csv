"1","","Solomon Sibley","1806","Democratic[4]","Solomon Sibley was the author of Detroit's first city charter in 1806, and became the city's first mayor under the charter.[3] However, when he found the office powerless in the face of the entrenched governor and judges, he resigned.[3] Sibley went on to serve as chair of Detroit's Board of Trustees during the time between mayoral control,[3] and later as a delegate to the United States House of Representatives and as a justice of the Michigan Supreme Court."
"2","","Elijah Brush","1806","","Elijah Brush was appointed to the mayor's chair after Sibley's resignation, but like Sibley found the position powerless and soon resigned himself.[3] He owned the ribbon farm immediately adjacent to Detroit, along which Brush Street now runs. Brush served as a lieutenant colonel in the Territorial Militia, and was taken prisoner during the War of 1812; he died soon after returning to Detroit in 1814.[3]"
