"","Pyotr Yakubovich (1860â\u0080\u00931911)","","The Ninth Wave[14] Not for every plashing wavelet Watches keen the helmsman's eye; He awaits the last huge roller, When the ninth wave surges high. But until that last strong roller Swells with deep, decisive roar, We must meet the strife and effort Of the waves that go before. Even though we scarce perceive them, Sinking vanquished to their grave, Wait, O brethren, wait with courage For the ninth, the conqu'ring wave!"

"","Nikolay Yazykov (1803â\u0080\u00931847)","","The Sailor[4] Cruel is our lonely ocean, Roaring always day and night; Buried 'neath its wild commotion Many a wreck lies, far from sight. Courage, comrades! I, confiding, To the free winds give my barque; Forth it hastens, swiftly riding O'er the billows grim and dark. Thick the clouds fly o'er the heaven, Fierce the gale grows, black the waves; Hither, thither we are driven, While the waking whirlwind raves. Courage, comrades ! Peals the thunder, High the watery heaps arise, Yawning gulfs now draw us under, Now we 're lifted to the skies. Yet behold, our ship is nearing Through the storm the wished-for land; See, the vaults of heaven are clearing, See, the port is near at hand. Thither but brave hearts and ready Will the billows speed along! Courage, comrades! straight and steady Flies our vessel, stanch and strong."

"","Sergey Yesenin (1895â\u0080\u00931925)","","\"Hopes Painted By The Autumn Cold\"[1] Hopes, painted by the autumn cold, are shining, My steady horse plods on, like quiet fate, His moist dun lip is catching at the lining When the coat, flapping, flutters and falls straight. On a far road the unseen traces, leading Neither to rest nor battle, lure and fade; The golden heel of day will flash, receding, And labors in the chest of years be laid."
