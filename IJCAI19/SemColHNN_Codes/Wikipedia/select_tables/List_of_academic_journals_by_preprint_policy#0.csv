"Press","Policy type","Policy text","Source"
"American Association for Cancer Research (AACR)","Incompatible","Submission page does not explicitly mention preprints, but numerous communications with the journal have confirmed that they do not consider papers for which a preprint has been submitted.","[1], [2] and [3]"
"American Institute of Physics (AIP)","Compatible","\"Author-prepared files only may be used; files prepared and\/or formatted by AIP Publishing or its vendors (e.g., the PDF, PostScript, or HTML article files published in the online journals and proceedings) may not be used for this purpose.\"","[4]"
"American Physical Society","Compatible","From the submission FAQ: \"E-print number, e.g., 0804.1718, assigned by the arXiv e-print servers. This can be used at submission to automatically download files from the e-print server.\"","[5]"
"American Phytopathological Society","Compatible","From the guidelines to the authors: \"Authors are allowed to present and discuss their findings ahead of publication at scientific conferences, on preprint servers (such as arXiv, bioRxiv, or PeerJ preprints among others), in public databases, and other informal communication channels. When submitting a manuscript for review, authors need to disclose preprints, databases, proceedings, or other preliminary communications or depositories. However, abstracts, conferences, or personal communications need not be disclosed. This prior disclosure does not constitute prior publication.\"","[6]"
"American Society for Microbiology","Compatible","From the submission FAQ: \"ASM journals will consider for publication manuscripts that have been posted in a recognized not-for-profit preprint archive, providing that upon acceptance of the manuscript for publication the author is still able to grant ASM copyright or agree to the terms of an Open Access license and pay the associated fee.\"","[7]"
"Nature Publishing Group","Compatible","The policy states \"Neither conference presentations nor posting on recognized preprint servers constitute prior publication,\" and an editorial explains: \"Nature never wishes to stand in the way of communication between researchers.[...] Communication between researchers includes not only conferences but also preprint servers. The ArXiv preprint server is the medium of choice for (mainly) physicists and astronomers who wish to share drafts of their papers with their colleagues, and with anyone else with sufficient time and knowledge to navigate it. [...] If scientists wish to display drafts of their research papers on an established preprint server before or during submission to Nature or any Nature journal, that's fine by us.\"","[8] and [9]"
"IOP Publishing","Compatible","You may post your Authorâ\u0080\u0099s Original on arXiv.org at any time prior to acceptance by IOP. Before acceptance of the article by an IOP journal you may not attribute it to any IOP journal. After acceptance you should add citation information, IOPâ\u0080\u0099s copyright information and, when appropriate, a link to the online abstract of the Version of Record, along with the following wording: â\u0080\u009CThis is an author-created, un-copyedited version of an article accepted for publication in [insert name of journal]. IOP Publishing Ltd is not responsible for any errors or omissions in this version of the manuscript or any version derived from it. The Version of Record is available online at [insert DOI].â\u0080\u009D. If you do post your Authorâ\u0080\u0099s Original on arXiv.org and wish to submit it to IOP for peer review you will be able to use the arXiv article ID number in our online submission form instead of uploading the files. We will automatically pick up the files from arXiv.org. Once you have submitted it to IOP, you may not post the Authorâ\u0080\u0099s Original on any other institutional or subject repository prior to acceptance, withdrawal or rejection of your article.","[10]"
"Oxford Journals","Compatible","\"Prior to acceptance for publication in the journal, authors retain the right to make their original version of the article available on their own personal website and\/or that of their employer and\/or in free public servers of original version articles in their subject area, provided that, upon acceptance, they acknowledge that the article has been accepted for publication as follows: This article has been accepted for publication in [Journal Title] Published by Oxford University Press.\"","[11]"
"Elsevier","Compatible","Elsevier is generally permissive with respect to authors and electronic preprints. \"(i) Authors can share their preprint anywhere at any time. (ii) [They] encourage authors to link from the preprint to their formal publication via its Digital Object Identifier (DOI). (iii) Authors can update their preprints on arXiv or RePEc with their accepted manuscript.\" [However, please note that Cell Press, The Lancet and some society-owned journals have their own preprint policies available in the Information to Authors.]","[12]"
"Springer, incl. SpringerOpen Journals and BioMed Central (BMC)","Compatible","Posting a manuscript on a pre-print server such as ArXiv is not considered to be duplicate publication. SpringerOpen\/Biomed Central will also consider peer reviewing manuscripts that have been posted on an author's personal or institutional website.","[13][14] [15]"
"Wiley-Blackwell","Probably compatible","[Wiley Self-Archiving Policy:] Authors of articles published in Wiley journals are permitted to self-archive the submitted (preprint) version of the article at any time, and may self-archive the accepted (peer-reviewed) version after an embargo period. There is no obligation upon authors to remove preprints posted to not for profit preprint servers prior to submission. Individual journals may have different policies, but pre-print policy seems to be universal, please check [16] for individual journals","[17] [18] [19]"
"PLOS","Compatible","[all PLOS Journals feature this language:] Authors may present and discuss their findings ahead of publication: at medical or scientific conferences, on preprint servers, in public databases, and in blogs, wikis, tweets, and other informal communication channels.","e.g. [20]"
"PeerJ","Compatible","PeerJ accepts submissions which have previously appeared on preprint servers (including PeerJ PrePrints and arXiv); have previously been presented at conferences; or have previously appeared in other â\u0080\u0098non journalâ\u0080\u0099 venues (for example: blogs or posters).","[21]"
"Royal Society Publishing","Compatible","8. Media embargo. The main findings of articles should not have been reported in the mass media. Like many journals, we employ a strict embargo policy where the reporting of a scientific article by the media is embargoed until a specific time. The Editor has final authority in all matters relating to publication. Posting of preprints on arXiv, PeerJ PrePrints and bioRxiv is permitted under this policy.","[22]"
"American Chemical Society","Most not compatible","\"Each ACS journal has a specific policy on prior publication that is determined by the ACS Editor in accordance with their final responsibility for editorial decisions relative to their publications. Details of the respective prior publication policies of each ACS journal is available at [23]\". In practice, most journals do not explicitly allow preprints.","[24]"
"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press","Compatible","Cold Spring Harbor journals only accept papers presenting original research that has not been published previously. Conference presentations or posting unrefereed manuscripts on not-for-profit community preprint servers will not be considered prior publication. Authors are responsible for updating the archived preprint with the journal reference (including DOI), and a link to the published article on the appropriate journal website upon publication.","For example: [25]"
"University of Chicago Press","Likely compatible","We place no conditions on posting a paper intended for submission (but not yet submitted) to one of our journals, except to note that posting a paper online may, in some cases, constitute prior publication â\u0080\u0093 for example, posting to a commercial venue and\/or to a venue with a formal review and approval process. Please consult the journalâ\u0080\u0099s editor if you have questions about whether or not a particular use constitutes prior publication.","[26]"
"NRC Research Press","Compatible","Authors retain the right to \"post a copy of their submitted manuscript (pre-print) on their own Web site, an institutional repository, a preprint server, or their funding body's designated archive (no embargo period)...\" and \"... post a copy of their accepted manuscript (post-print) on their own Web site, an institutional repository, a preprint server, or their funding body's designated archive (no embargo period). Authors who archive or self-archive accepted articles are asked to provide a hyperlink from the manuscript to the Journal's Web site.\"","[27]"
"iMedPub","Compatible","Authors retain the right to \"post a copy of their submitted manuscript (pre-print) on their own Web site, an institutional repository, a preprint server, or their funding body's designated archive (no embargo period)...\" and \"... post a copy of their accepted manuscript (post-print) on their own Web site, an institutional repository, a preprint server, or their funding body's designated archive (no embargo period).
