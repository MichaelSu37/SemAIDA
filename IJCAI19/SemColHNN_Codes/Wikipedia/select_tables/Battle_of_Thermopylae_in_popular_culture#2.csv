"Heinrich BÃ¶ll","Wanderer, kommst Du nach Spa...","This short story takes its title from the German translation of the inscription on the Spartans' tomb. In it a young German soldier at the end of the Second World War is wounded on the Eastern Front and is brought to a field hospital, which had been a school. He wonders if it could be his school, which he had only recently left to become a soldier. On seeing in his own writing the truncated quotation of the title on a chalkboard, his question is answered. (\"Sparta\" was truncated because the narrator had run out of room at the edge of the board.)"
